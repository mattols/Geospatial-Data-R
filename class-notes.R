# Notes and code testing GDS course
# GEOG-490R
# Spring 2024
#

## Use existing datasets!
# all data and methods should be Earth science based

### Weekly breakdown

### 1. Github Basics and Rstudio setup
# discuss R, register, and discuss basics of programming
#
# task 01
# My first script
#
### 2. Data types, basic R methods
# Intro to GitHub
# data types: string, integer, data.frame, etc., 
# reading in a file, plotting information
#
# task 02
# Exploring a dataset
# change to iris dataset
#
# case study 01
# 
#
### 3. Better data visualizations 
# GitHub workflows
# use ggplot, continue exploring data types, etc.
# use dataset from faculty or UGRC

### 4. Data wrangling & statistical models
# USGS water dataset
# skills test 1

### 5. Vector data 
# reading and visualizing vector data
# UGRC data
# SNOTEL Data
# basic attribute analysis
# look at Zahn guest lecture

## 6. Vector analysis
# Spatial relationships, joins and data aggregation, choropleth mapping
# spatial interpolation, Kriging
# Kripa project - Precip variability & water towers
# ?? introduce custom functions?

### 7. Raster data 
# terrain analysis
# suitability analysis - avalanches - or bigfoot (maybe later?)
# look at zahn guest lecture

### 8. Raster analysis
# Drosophila case study

### SPRING BREAK (data unclear) ###

### 9. Project proposals and interactive mapping
# plotting with leaflet
# creating polygons on the fly (draw etc.)

# skills test 2
# terrible maps???

### 10. Remote Sensing I
# basic NDVI, or classification
# ?? case studies could all include GEE for final weeks

### 11. Time-series datasets and temporal statistics
# time-series modeling 
# lag and correlation between MODIS SCA and RF
# ?? include GEE library ??

### 12. Remote Sensing II
# hyperspectral from Noah

### 13. Creating custom functions and tools
# could create custom tool for OLI-DRFS

# Skills test 3

### 14. Spatial Modeling (could be earlier?) - incorporated in vector II
# functions
# Solar Radiation?
# Ecological Modeling

### 15-16. Project Workshops


# ideas for datasets
# glacier length
# minimal glacier models
# USGS water data
# SNOTEL
# Mountain Project climbs - with rock types - distance to?
