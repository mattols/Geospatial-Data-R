## GEOG 490R Special Topics: Geospatial Data Science
###  Spring 2024 

> Instructor: Dr. Matt Olson  \
> Email: use Canvas messaging or Matt.Olson@uvu.edu \
> Time: Tues/Thurs 2:30-3:45pm \
> Location: SB 175 (GIS Peper Lab) \
> Office Hours: TBA, [Book a time](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/99affef35d9f4707be160110794033e8@uvu.edu?anonymous&ep=bwmEmailSignature) \

## Course Description. 

This course introduces geospatial data science, covering key concepts and techniques for working with geographic data in the R computing environment. Students will learn methods for acquiring, organizing, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing spatial data while gaining hands-on programming experience using R. Real-world examples and spatial data sets will be utilized during assignments and projects. By the end of the course, students will be able to carry out basic geospatial data science workflows in R and apply these skills to relevant problems. 

*This course is equivalent to Geospatial Data Science (GEOG 3440) – which will be offered beginning Spring 2025.*

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to: \

* Manage common geospatial data formats alongside proper project organization and version control 
* Apply data wrangling techniques to prepare spatial data for analysis in R 
* Utilize different quantitative methods and geospatial techniques to analyze spatial and non-spatial data 
* Model geographic phenomena and relationships using spatial data science techniques 
* Visualize and communicate geographic information through mapping and graphing methods 
* Create reproducible geospatial data science workflows using R and R Markdown 

### Class Format.  

* Two 75-minute face-to-face class periods per week 
* Class will consist of short lectures, group work, and individual help with assignments and projects
* Skills acquired throughout the semester will culminate into a final project 

## Resources. 
This course will focus on open-source software, texts, and other resources. Which means that everything is free for anyone anywhere to use, if you have access to a computer and the internet. Open-source resources and programs level the playing field and make science and learning more equitable. 

### Free Course Texts. 
* [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/) by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow (ISBN 9781138304512) 
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickam, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Garret Grolemund 
* [R-spatial](https://r-spatial.org/)
* Additional readings will be posted  

### Additional resources. 
* Several other online resources exist! We'll discover these throughout the semester.

### Software. 
* R and RStudio (Free and open source) 
  + important packages including sf, tmap, leaflet, sp, rgdal, raster, terra, etc. 
* We may dabble in Google Earth Engine 
* Possibly explore geoprocessing with python within QGIS or ArcGISPro (but probably not) 

## Course Structure. 

### Grading. 
* **Participation:** 15% 
  + Participation: Attendance, group discussions, and notes from readings
* **Tasks:** 20%   
  + Tasks: Weekly assignments to build necessary skills throughout the semester, tasks will become progressively more difficult
* **Case Studies:** 20% 
  + Case Studies: Assigned regularly and will challenge students to apply knowledge to explore a real-world science question or geospatial problem 
* **Skills Tests:** 15% 
  + Skills tests: Short exams to test your skills in learning the R programming language, expect 3-4 throughout the semester.
* **Final Project:** 30% 
  + Final Project: The culminating effort of this class will test your ability to apply what you have learned in a class project. The last several weeks of class will focus on preparing students for their project presentation

### Class policies. 
* All assignments must be complete and “solved” *on your OWN!* Learning to problem solve is a key aspect of data science
* Assignments are due at 11:59 pm on due dates, typically one week after they are assigned
* Late work will receive a 6% deduction per day
* Makeups only given for excused absences with documentation 


### University Policies. 

* AI Statement:Generative AI tools present new ways to brainstorm, fine-tune, and add additional information to your work. These programs are not meant to replace you or your effort when completing a course. Using AI responsibly is import for the modern student and human. Ultimately you are responsible for your assignment submissions in this course and should use personal knowledge, critical thinking, and good judgement with the aid of resources (such as generative AI) to complete assignments. Student work submitting with the help of an AI query should be explicitly stated. No more than 25% of the work can be generated by AI. Plagiarism is no longer limited to the theft of human intellect alone. Reach out if you have any further questions. 

* Academic Integrity: University policies clearly state that plagiarism, cheating, or fabrication will not be tolerated. Give credit where credit is due. Minor violations will result in a failing grade for the assignment and major violations may be reported to the University (possibly resulting in failing the course). For further information, see UVU Policy 541: Student Code of ConductLinks to an external site.. 

* Diversity and Inclusion: “Come as you are. UVU has a place for you.”--President Tuminez. Your experience in this class is important to me and I want you to feel welcome. My goal is to create an inclusive learning atmosphere where students can share, express, and contribute in a safe environment. Please contact me if you have suggestions or concerns. You may also contact the Inclusion and Diversity CommitteeLinks to an external site. to ask for help and support. 

* Food, Housing, Health and Safety: Check out the UVU CARELinks to an external site. page for more resources  

* Additional needs: Students needing accommodations due to a disability including temporary and pregnancy accommodations may contact the UVU Accessibility ServicesLinks to an external site. at accessibilityservices@uvu.edu or 801-863-8747. Accessibility Services is located on the Orem Campus in LC 312.
