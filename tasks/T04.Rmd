### Streamlined workflows

Nice work! You've made it through the first couple weeks learning many of the capabilities and tricks in R. One of the best aspects of an open-source programming language is that it is a community built tool and features thousands of useful packages to perform general or more specific analysis. You will learn about a few key packages this week.

You will also learn how to make functions in R. When you have a specific task, it can be useful to call a customized function rather than repeat unnecessary lines of code.

\

#### 1. Introducing Packages!

While there are several benefits in learning the base R functions, some of the added libraries we will use are much better. Having general familiarity with structures and workflows in base R will help you once we get to the geospatial data aspect of this class.

This week we will move our data wrangling and analysis to incorporate a few key libraries in R. We will focus on the following packages, most of which are associated with the *tidyverse*:

- `dplyr`
- `tidy`
- `ggplot`
- `...`

\

A few key functions that we mentioned in class include: dplyr piping with `%>%` and data transformation with functions like `mutate()` and `filter()`, the ggplot structure, added statistical packages, and tidying data with special functions.

\

#### 2. Introducing Custom Functions!

Wouldn't you like to build your own tool that is tailored for your need? Who wouldn't?

Creating functions in R can make your code more compact and efficient. Rather than repeating your code or implimenting a for loop, consider creating a function to perform the task!

We worked on the basics behind creating functions this week.

#### Your Task

Your task this week is to read in, clean, and analyze the snotel (or USGS) csv file from Canvas. OR DAir Quality Data

Be sure to answer all of the following questions in your analysis:

* Transform the data to include the station name along with the code
* ...
