### Solar Farm Production Analysis

You are an analyst at a solar power company. The director has asked you to analyze data on energy production at their solar farms to identify factors that influence and predict power output. 

You are provided historical data on daily energy production, solar irradiation, temperature, and panel degradation at a solar farm over the last 30 days.

Conduct an analysis on this sample data:

#### Load data

```r
# 30 days of energy production (kWh)
production <- c(1500, 1480, 1530, 1510, 1470, 1490, 1460, 1450, 1520, 1495,  
                1510, 1520, 1500, 1490, 1540, 1560, 1480, 1470, 1500, 1480, 
                1490, 1520, 1540, 1510, 1480, 1500, 1520, 1490, 1510, 1470)
                
# 30 days of solar irradiation (kW/m2) 
irradiation <- c(0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.85, 0.6, 0.75, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8, 0.78,   
                 0.82, 0.85, 0.78, 0.83, 0.86, 0.82, 0.8, 0.68, 0.92, 0.89,  
                 0.82, 0.85, 0.86, 0.8, 0.73, 0.81, 0.85, 0.9, 0.92, 0.88)
                 
# 30 days of temperature (Celsius)
temp <- c(18, 17, 22, 20, 15, 16, 12, 14, 19, 21,  
          15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 19, 11, 23, 25,
          18, 21, 22, 20, 19, 15, 21, 25, 26, 20)
          
# 30 days of degradation (percentage)
degrade <- c(10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12,
             10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 12, 
             12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12)
```

#### Analysis

1) Calculate the mean production across the 30 days.

2) Determine the maximum daily production.

3) Calculate the standard deviation of the irradiation measurements.

4) Build a linear model to predict production based on irradiation and temperature. Evaluate the model R^2. 

5) Estimate average production if temperature was 5 degrees C higher, using your model.

6) Make a scatterplot of production vs. irradiation and assess if the relationship appears linear.

7) Calculate the mean degradation and analyze if degradation seems to impact production.

8) Convert the average daily production from kWh to gigajoule (GJ), given the conversion factor 1 kWh = 0.0036 GJ.

9) If the solar farm covers 5 km2, calculate the total kW generated over the 30 days
