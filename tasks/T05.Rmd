#### 3. Custom Functions

Wouldn't you like to build your own tool that is tailored for your need? Who wouldn't?

Creating functions in R can make your code more compact and efficient. Rather than repeating your code or implementing a for loop, consider creating a function to perform the task!

We worked on the basics behind creating functions this week, here is a reminder:

```{r}
multiply_by_2 <- function(values){ 
  # code and operations
  new_vals <- values * 2
  return(new_vals) # return values
}
```
