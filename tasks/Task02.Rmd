## Exploring a dataset

Here is your first task. It should be very straightforward. 

You are going to create a simple plot, and answer a few questions, with a built-in dataset contained in R. You will be using base functions in R, which is to say that you do not need to load any additional libraries. *We'll learn several new, useful libraries throughout the semester.*

**For this task** you will recreate the following graph:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load built-in mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)

# Create scatterplot using plot()
plot(mtcars$wt, 
     mtcars$mpg, 
     main="Motor Vehicle Mileage vs Weight",
     xlab="Weight",
     ylab="Miles Per Gallon")

# Add regression line 
abline(lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt))
```

This code uses the `mtcars` dataset, this data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The code above creates a basic scatterplot of weight (wt) vs miles per gallon (mpg), adds axis labels and a title, and plots a regression line. 

The key functions from base R are:

- `data()` to load a built-in dataset
- `plot()` to create the initial scatterplot
- `abline()` to add a regression line
- `lm()` to fit linear model for the regression line

To learn more about any function you can type in the function name, for example `plot` will show you the basic function. For a more detailed explanation of a function, type `?plot` to open the help window in the Rstudio console.

### Data description

In addition to recreating the plot above, you will need to describe the dataset we are using. There are many different kinds of data that can be used

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# First few rows 
# head(mtcars, 3)
print("...what is this?")
```

Here are some useful R functions to investigate a dataframe in R markdown, along with brief explanations:

- `class()`: View kind of R object for any variable
- `colnames()`: View column names of dataframe
- `dim()`: View the dimension, or number of rows and columns 
- `summary()`: Summary stats for each column
- `head()/tail()`: View first/last few rows
- several other functions exist as well

### Your task

For this assignment, you will create an R script that describes the `mtcars` dataset using the functions above. You will also write a brief paragraph that summarizes this dataset and results from the plots you created.

#### Submitting
